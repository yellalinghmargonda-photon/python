Example
Input:
array = [8, 3, 7, 6, 2, 5]

Steps:
Choose Pivot:

Let's choose 5 as the pivot.
Partition:

Rearrange elements so that elements < 5 are on the left and elements > 5 are on the right.
Partitioned array: [3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 6].
Recurse:

Left sub-array: [3, 2]
Choose 2 as the pivot.
Partition: [2, 3].
Right sub-array: [8, 7, 6]
Choose 6 as the pivot.
Partition: [6, 7, 8].
Combine:

Combine the sorted sub-arrays: [2, 3] + [5] + [6, 7, 8].
Output:
[2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
